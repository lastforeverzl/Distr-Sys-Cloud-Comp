The objective of this course is to give us a basic grounding in designing and implementing distributed and cloud systems. Developers of cloud services question how those services should be implemented. What are global consensus and Paxos, and what are their application in building cloud
systems? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using distributed NoSQL stores such as Cassandra instead of relational stores such as MySQL? What are strong and weak consistency, what is the "CAP Theorem," and what is its implication for building highly available services? What are the roles of REST, Websockets and stream processing in cloud applications? This course will combine hands-on experience in developing cloud services, with a firm grounding in the tools and principles of building distributed and cloud applications, including advanced architectures such as peer-to-peer, publish-subscribe and streaming. Besides cloud services, we will also be looking at
cloud support for batch processing, such as the Hadoop and Pig frameworks, and their use with NoSQL data stores such as Cassandra.
